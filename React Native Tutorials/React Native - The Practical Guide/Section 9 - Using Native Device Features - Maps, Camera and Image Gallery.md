# Section 9 - Using Native Device Features - Maps, Camera and Image Gallery

## A Note on Installing React-Native Maps
Section 9, Lecture 132
Since I recorded the course, the installation steps you have to go through to install react-native-maps (which we'll set up in the next lecture) changed slightly.

I do reference the official installation instructions in the next lecture anyways and I basically copy & paste the commands/ code you need to add from the official docs.

That's exactly what you should still do, even if the docs changed slightly (i.e. I copy different code than you'll have to copy).

You find the installation instructions on this page: https://github.com/react-community/react-native-maps/blob/master/docs/installation.md
